# Dice Roller

Quick build dice roller I put together in a couple hours because the clunky old online roller one of my players liked went offline. 

Looks funky on mobile, like a true "classic" website. I'll fix it later.

## Dice Roller

Select dice type, modifiers, etc, and roll your dice -- the result will be kept in the result column until overwritten, and all previous dice rolls will be reported at the bottom of the page in the roll history box. Newest rolls are at the top.

I drew this in paint to capture the feel of the mid 90's
